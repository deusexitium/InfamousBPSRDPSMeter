---

## 📋 Known Limitations (By Design)

### Intentional Choices
- ⚠️ **Windows Only** - Uses Windows-specific packet capture
- ⚠️ **Requires Admin** - Needed for packet capture permissions
- ⚠️ **No Auto-Update** - User downloads new versions manually (prevents forced updates)
- ⚠️ **No Telemetry** - Privacy-focused, no data collection
- ⚠️ **Local Only** - No cloud sync, all data stays on user's PC

### Technical Constraints
- ⚠️ Depends on game's packet structure (may break with major game updates)
- ⚠️ Npcap required (third-party dependency)
- ⚠️ Cannot detect abilities not captured in packets
- ⚠️ Some skill names may be untranslated (limited translation table)
