# BPSR Meter v2.5.1 - Complete Feature Update

## üéâ Major Features Added

- Export to MDC (Markdown) format for documentation
- Includes all player stats: DPS, HPS, DMG, GS, Crit%, Lucky%, Max DMG
- Timestamped exports with duration info

**Result:** Easy data sharing and analysis!

### 3. ‚úÖ Advanced Player Details Modal

**Result:** No more data loss during combat!
