# Electron DPS Meter - Fixes Applied

## Session: 2025-01-XX

### Critical Fixes Completed

#### 1. **Pointer Events Issues (FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Body had `pointer-events: none` causing all clicks to fail
- **Solution**: Removed body-level pointer blocking, simplified CSS rules
- **Impact**: All buttons, tabs, and player rows now clickable

#### 2. **Window Movability Issues (FIXED)**  
- **Problem**: Over-aggressive workarounds caused window to freeze/stick
- **Solution**: Simplified Electron main process, removed redundant event handlers
- **Impact**: Window moves smoothly, no more stuck states

#### 3. **Click-Through Mode (FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Lock mode affected wrong elements
- **Solution**: Changed CSS to only block player list when locked, keep title bar interactive
- **Impact**: Can always unlock window, overlay mode works correctly

#### 4. **CSS Specificity Conflicts (FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Conflicting pointer-events rules fighting each other
- **Solution**: Removed `!important` overrides, simplified rule hierarchy
- **Impact**: Predictable behavior, no CSS conflicts
