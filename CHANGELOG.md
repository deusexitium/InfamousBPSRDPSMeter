## [2.96.4] - 2025-10-26 üîß HOTFIX 4 - Restore Taskbar Visibility

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** App not showing in taskbar
  - Changed `skipTaskbar: true` ‚Üí `skipTaskbar: false`
  - User needs to see app in taskbar (Alt+Tab)
  - Was removed in Phase 3 (bpsr-logs inspiration) but users expect it

### Note
- User reverted to v2.96.3 sizing (900x350, min 800x250)
- Core functionality preserved from previous working version
- **skipTaskbar was the ONLY change needed**

---

## [2.96.3] - 2025-10-26 üîß HOTFIX 3 - Fix Too Narrow Width

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Window was TOO NARROW - right side buttons cut off
- Initial width: 450px ‚Üí 900px (show full UI)
- Min width: 350px ‚Üí 800px (ensure all buttons visible)
- Min height: 150px ‚Üí 250px
- Max width restored: 1400px ‚Üí 1600px

### The Real Problem
- Previous versions made window too narrow
- Header buttons (settings, lock, pin, etc) were cut off on right side
- User couldn't see or click critical UI controls
- Window needs minimum 800px width to show complete interface

---

## [2.96.2] - 2025-10-26 üîß HOTFIX 2 - Width & Responsiveness

### Fixed
- **Width too wide:** Initial width 600‚Üí450px, min 400‚Üí350px
- **Window constraints:** max 1600‚Üí1400px, min height 200‚Üí150px
- **Width calculation:** Allow narrower windows (350px minimum)
- **Added debug logging:** Track data fetching for troubleshooting
- **UI responsiveness:** Ensure buttons visible at smaller widths

### Changed
- Initial window: 600x300 ‚Üí 450x250
- Min width: 400px ‚Üí 350px
- Max width: 1600px ‚Üí 1400px
- Min height: 200px ‚Üí 150px
- Width constraint in auto-resize: 400px ‚Üí 350px minimum

---

## [2.96.1] - 2025-10-26 üîß HOTFIX - Accurate Window Sizing

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Window sizing now matches ACTUAL visible content precisely
  - Using `getBoundingClientRect()` for exact measurements
  - Reduced padding from 40px to 10px (minimal safety margin)
  - Debounce reduced from 50ms to 10ms (faster response)
  - Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for immediate DOM-ready resizing
  - Initial window size: 600x300 (smaller, will grow to content)

### Changed
- Window measurement: `container.scrollHeight` ‚Üí `container.getBoundingClientRect().height`
- Padding: 40px ‚Üí 10px
- Debounce: 50ms ‚Üí 10ms  
- Resize trigger: After DOM paint completes
- Min constraints: 400x200 (allows smaller windows)

### Technical
- Force layout calculation before measurement
- Double requestAnimationFrame ensures DOM is painted
- Resize on ANY size difference (not just >20px)
- Faster response time for dynamic content

---

## [2.96.0] - 2025-10-26 üöÄ PHASE 3 & 4 - Overlay Perfection

### **Inspired by bpsr-logs Professional Overlay**

### Added
- **Skip Taskbar** (`skipTaskbar: true`)
  - Overlay doesn't clutter Alt+Tab menu
  - Professional overlay-only experience
  - Not visible in Windows taskbar switcher

- **Shadow Removal** (`hasShadow: false`)
