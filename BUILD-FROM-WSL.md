# ðŸš€ Build from WSL (No Export Required!)

## Quick Build

Instead of exporting the archive and building on Windows, you can build directly from WSL:

```bash
cd /development/BPSR-Meter
./build-from-wsl.sh
```

This script will:
1. âœ… Copy source to Windows temp directory
2. âœ… Install dependencies on Windows  
3. âœ… Build Windows installer using Windows tools
4. âœ… Copy the installer back to WSL
5. âœ… Clean up (optional)

---

## Requirements

- WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Node.js and pnpm installed on **Windows** (not just WSL)
- Windows 10/11

---

## How It Works

The script uses WSL's ability to execute Windows commands from Linux:
- Copies source to Windows temp folder
- Runs `cmd.exe` to execute pnpm/electron-builder on Windows
- The build happens natively on Windows (required for `cap` library)
- Copies the final installer back to WSL

---

## Result

After completion, you'll have:
- **WSL location:** `/development/BPSR-Meter-Setup-2.8.0.exe`
- **Windows location:** `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\BPSR-Meter-Build\dist_electron\`

---

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "pnpm: command not found"**
- Install pnpm on Windows: `npm install -g pnpm` (from Windows PowerShell/CMD)

**Error: "Failed to install dependencies"**
- Make sure Node.js 22.15.0+ is installed on Windows
- Run Windows Command Prompt as Administrator

**Error: "cap" build failed**
- This is expected if building from pure WSL
- The script builds on Windows to avoid this issue

---

## Why This Works

The `cap` (packet capture) library requires:
- Windows native compilation
- Access to Windows network drivers
- electron-builder needs Windows for signing

By building on Windows but controlling it from WSL, we get the best of both worlds!
