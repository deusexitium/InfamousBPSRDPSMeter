## üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers

### üîß Build Instructions

**Recommended: WSL ‚Üí Windows Hybrid Build**  
Development in WSL, building on Windows for best compatibility.

#### Quick Build (from WSL):
```bash
# From WSL terminal in project directory
bash build-from-wsl.sh
```

**What this does:**
1. Copies source from WSL to Windows temp directory
2. Installs dependencies on Windows (pnpm)
3. Builds Windows installer using electron-builder
4. Copies installer back to WSL and F:/DPS
5. Auto-detects version from package.json

#### Manual Build (Windows Native):
```cmd
# Run in Windows Command Prompt (as Administrator)
pnpm install
pnpm dist
```

#### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js:** v3.1.52+ (Windows)
- **pnpm:** Latest version
- **Windows 10/11:** Build must run on Windows
- **Code signing:** Certificate installed for signing .exe

üìñ **Detailed Instructions:** [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VPN Limitations
**VPNs interfere with packet capture - use with caution**

- ‚ùå **Not Recommended** - VPNs encrypt/redirect packets causing unreliable data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ExitLag** - "Legacy - NDIS" mode has partial compatibility (~70-80% accuracy)
- ‚ùå **Kernel-Level VPNs** - Completely incompatible (packets encrypted before capture)
- ‚úÖ **Best Practice** - Disable VPN when using meter for 100% accuracy
- üí° **Auto-Detection** - Automatically selects adapter with most traffic

**Note:** VPN compatibility is experimental. Data may be incomplete or inaccurate when VPN is active. For best results, disable VPN during combat analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### Application Issues

**No data showing:**
1. Install Npcap with WinPcap compatibility
2. Run BPSR Meter as Administrator
3. Start Blue Protocol before the meter
4. Change instance/channel once (forces packet capture)
5. Check firewall isn't blocking

**Window is sluggish/slow to drag:**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED in Enhanced Edition!**
- Now uses native webkit dragging
- Smooth and responsive

**Alt+Tab hides window behind game:**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED in Enhanced Edition!**
- Enhanced always-on-top with focus handlers
- Window stays visible

**Players showing as "Unknown":**
- Change instance/channel
- Wait 5-10 seconds for packet capture
- Check network adapter selection in logs

**Sorting doesn't work properly:**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED in Enhanced Edition!**
- Robust sorting with proper data handling
- Click DMG/TANK/HEAL to change sort

### Build Issues

**"cap" compilation fails:**
```bash
# Linux/WSL:
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

# Windows:
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```

**Python not found:**
```bash
# Install Python 3.11+
# Windows: winget install Python.Python.3.11
```

**Electron builder fails:**
```bash
# Windows only - install Visual Studio Build Tools
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.BuildTools
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Is using this meter a bannable offense?**
> It operates in a "gray area." It doesn't modify game files, inject code, or alter the game's memory. Historically, tools that only read data have an extremely low risk of being banned. However, **use it at your own risk.**

**Does it affect my game's performance (FPS)?**
> No. The impact is virtually zero, as packet capturing is a passive and very lightweight process.

**Why does it need to run as an administrator?**
> To allow the Npcap library to have low-level access to network adapters and monitor the game's packets.

**What's different from the original version?**
> This Enhanced Edition features modern UI improvements, performance optimizations, complete English translation, and accurate skill data from the community.

**Does it work with ExitLag?**
> Yes, but set ExitLag to "Legacy-NDIS" mode and allow 30 seconds out of combat for auto-clear.

**Does it work on the Chinese server?**
> Yes, it works correctly on the Chinese server.

**Can I contribute?**
> Yes! Pull requests are welcome. Please test thoroughly and follow the existing code style.
