## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICES

### Windows Build Only
**This application MUST be built on Windows.** Do NOT build in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

- ‚úÖ **Build on:** Windows 10/11 native
- ‚ùå **Do NOT build on:** WSL, Linux, macOS
- üìñ **See:** [BUILD-WINDOWS.md](BUILD-WINDOWS.md) for detailed instructions

**Quick Build (Windows):**
```cmd
# Run in Command Prompt (as Administrator)
pnpm install
pnpm dist
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VPN Limitations
**VPNs interfere with packet capture - use with caution**

- ‚ùå **Not Recommended** - VPNs encrypt/redirect packets causing unreliable data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ExitLag** - "Legacy - NDIS" mode has partial compatibility (~70-80% accuracy)
- ‚ùå **Kernel-Level VPNs** - Completely incompatible (packets encrypted before capture)
- ‚úÖ **Best Practice** - Disable VPN when using meter for 100% accuracy
- üí° **Auto-Detection** - Automatically selects adapter with most traffic

**Note:** VPN compatibility is experimental. Data may be incomplete or inaccurate when VPN is active. For best results, disable VPN during combat analysis.

- ‚úÖ **FIXED in Enhanced Edition!**
- Robust sorting with proper data handling
- Click DMG/TANK/HEAL to change sort

### Build Issues

**"cap" compilation fails:**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Is using this meter a bannable offense?**
> It operates in a "gray area." It doesn't modify game files, inject code, or alter the game's memory. Historically, tools that only read data have an extremely low risk of being banned. However, **use it at your own risk.**

**Does it affect my game's performance (FPS)?**
> No. The impact is virtually zero, as packet capturing is a passive and very lightweight process.

**Why does it need to run as an administrator?**
> To allow the Npcap library to have low-level access to network adapters and monitor the game's packets.

**What's different from the original version?**
> This Enhanced Edition features modern UI improvements, performance optimizations, complete English translation, and accurate skill data from the community.

**Does it work with ExitLag?**
> Yes, but set ExitLag to "Legacy-NDIS" mode and allow 30 seconds out of combat for auto-clear.

**Does it work on the Chinese server?**
> Yes, it works correctly on the Chinese server.

**Can I contribute?**
> Yes! Pull requests are welcome. Please test thoroughly and follow the existing code style.
